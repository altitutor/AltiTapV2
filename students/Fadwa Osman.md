## Subsidy
### Application email
I am applying for the subsidy program on behalf of both my sister and I (Wahaj). Our dad is a full time uni student and so our income is limited however we would still like receive tutoring at an affordable price, hence why weâ€™re applying for the subsidised cost.

### Interview
1. **About** - tell me about yourself and your family
	- Dad - full time uni student
			- Has a satellite business but not much clients 
	- Mum - unemployed 
	- Seven siblings - all of them are school students (youngest sibling is 9; parents have to pay tuition for most siblings) 
	- Goes to Australian Islamic college - all siblings go to this school 
	- Dad is looking for job and can pay full rate once the family is stable
1. **Income** - what are all of the income sources for your family?
	- Dad's satellite company 
	- Centrelink payments
1.  **Expenses** - what are all the sources of expenses for your family?
	- School tuition 
	- Rent/mortgage 
	- Everyday necessities - food, water, bills, etc. 
1. **Subsidy level** - how much can you afford to pay for tutoring (per class)?
	- Fadwa is thinking of dropping Chemistry and just do Methods 
		--> Wahaj - 12CHEM 
		--> Fadwa - 11CHEM 

$25.00 per subject so $50.00/week 
$25.00 per 1.5 hours* 

Fadwa - has gone to 1
Wahaj has gone to 2
