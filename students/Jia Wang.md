Name of student applying: Jia Wang  
Email:Â [lachlan.wang2008@gmail.com](mailto:lachlan.wang2008@gmail.com)  
Phone number: 0420923016  
Which course would you like to apply for? Select all that apply.: SACE Mathematical Methods, SACE Chemistry, SACE Biology, SACE English General  
Which days are you available to meet for a subsidy interview? Select all that apply.: Thursday, Friday, Sunday morning, Sunday afternoon  
Why are you applying for the subsidy program?: I'm currently caught in a tough spot where my parents have split, and most of the money for my extracurricular stuff comes from my mother. This has really affected our financial status. Dad's also out of work and we're all on a concession card, and currently under centre link carer concession. On top of that, my parents are juggling the care of both sets of grandparents, making sure they're happy and healthy. Even with all that on our plate, I'd be very grateful for a shot at joining your school. Getting to learn there would mean the world to me. I want to understand things better so I can chase my dream of becoming a dentist or a doctor, and hopefully make things easier for my family down the line. In return I hope I can help provide more support to the children similar to my current situation in the future.

Subjects: Methods, Biology 

Subsidy:
- Parents aren't together (mum only pays for extracurricular)
- Mum is a librarian 

$20.00 per subject ($40.00 for two subjects)
